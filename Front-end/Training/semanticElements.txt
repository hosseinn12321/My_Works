A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

***The <section> element defines a section in a document.

A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

***The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

    Forum posts
    Blog posts
    User comments
    Product cards
    Newspaper articles

**** Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.

***The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.
**** Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 

***The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

***The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.

***The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document.
The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.
